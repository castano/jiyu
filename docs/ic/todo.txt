- enums
    - llvm backend: output enum types.

    - enum flags?

    - Ensure that the constant value for each enum member must be in the range of the underlying type for the enum.

    - The associated value of an enum member may not, directly or indirectly, use the value of its own associated enum member.

        enum Circular {
            A = B;
            B;
        }

- operator functions.

- multiple declarations in a single line:

    var x, y, z, w: float;
    var x, y, z, w = 0.0;
    let PI, pi = 3.14159;

- defer statements.

- print with var args or string interpolation?

- passing function pointers as arguments, function typealias.

- default argument values. The parser accepts default values, but implementation does not seem to be complete.

- named arguments. 
    I think jai was overcomplicated, but swift is too restrictive. My preference would be to allow optional argument labelling, but 
    no reordering, only omission of arguments that are default-initialized.
